Instructions for Multi Muse

HOW TO ADD MUSES:
    1. Add an icon to the muse selection.
        1.1 You can find it easily if you search for 'muse icon starts'
        1.2 Copy from where it reads 'muse icon starts' to 'muse icon ends'
        1.3 Paste it at the end of the list
        1.4 Each link has a 'data-tab' (for example: data-tab="tab1")
        1.5 Change the 'data-tab' of the one that you just pasted to something unique (for example: <img data-tab="tab15" ...>)

    2. Each section will be listed with a comment 'muse 1 starts' until 'muse 1 ends'.
        2.1 Copy from where it reads 'muse 1 starts' to 'muse 1 ends'
        2.2 Paste it at the end of the list
        2.3 Each tab will have an id (<div id="tab1" ) 2.4 Change the id of the tab that you just pasted to the same that you've
        written in the previous step (<div id="tab15" ...>)

    3. Each subtab will be listed with a comment
    1st tab - overview starts -> 1st tab - overview ends
    2nd tab - biography starts -> 2nd tab - biography ends
    3rd tab - verses starts -> 3rd tab - verses ends
    4th tab - people of note starts -> 4th tab - people of note ends

        3.1 Each of the subtabs them has an id (<div id="tab1a" ) 
		3.2 You need to change the id to the number that you've picked on the previous step (div id="tab15a" ) 

    4. You have a navigation (black bar) in each character tab for overview, biography, verses and people of
        interest.
        4.1 Each link inside of the navigation has a 'data-tab' (for example: <a data-tab="tab1a" ) 
        4.2 Change the 'data-tab' number to match the number that you have used, it needs to be unique 
            (for example: <div data-tab="tab15a" ...> ...</div>
                <div data-tab="tab15b" ...> ...)

HOW TO REMOVE LINKS FROM CHARACTER NAVIGATION (black bar)
    0. DON'T remove the overview the tab that will always have 'a'. (for example: <div data-tab"=tab1a">)
    1. You will see a section with the comment 'sub menu with links'
    2. Remove elements that have the number and letter that you want removed
        (for example: <div data-tab="tab1b">...</div>)
    3. Remove the subtab that has the same id.
        3.1 Search 'id=tab1b' and delete from where it reads '2nd tab - biography starts' until '2nd tab - biography
        ends'
